# SnarkJS in Browser

We prepare our HTML file that we will use within Webview here. You can simply open it as `open ./src/snarkjs.html`. Since we are using webview, we need to write the minified JS code directly within the script tag, instead of importing it via `<script src="...">`. To get the code to copy-paste, do `yarn copy` and it will get you the `snarkjs.min.js` under `src`, copied from `node_modules`.
